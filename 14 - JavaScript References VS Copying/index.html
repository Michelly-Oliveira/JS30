        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        const team = players;
        // console.log(players, team);

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        team[3] = 'Lux';

        // now here is the problem!
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        // one way
        const myCopy = players.slice();
        myCopy[3] = 'Poppy';

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const myCopy1 = [].concat(players);
        myCopy1[3] = 'Poppy';

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const myCopy2 = [...players];
        myCopy2[3] = 'Poppy';

        const team1 = Array.from(players);
        team1[3] = "Howdy";

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        captain.number = 99;

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain1 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100});

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
